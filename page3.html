          <p>“Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family” - Kofi Annan. Francine Prose is a critic, who believed that the books being taught in high school classrooms are not up to the standard of great works of literature. Furthermore, Prose believed that love for reading is nurtured in high school classrooms and that students should be reading for the actual writing rather than the moral message in the writing. Additionally, Prose says that reading for the actual writing stimulates new ideas and different perspectives. James Baldwin believed that the actual history of African Americans is not being taught in American high schools as he believed that if they acknowledge the actual history, America would begin to question it’s identity. Furthermore, Baldwin believed that the government only works for certain people and that African American are set up from a young age to fail. Ralph Waldo Emerson believed that the best teacher is nature and that teachers should learn to respect and appreciate individual qualities of the students. Therefore, Prose, Baldwin, and Emerson can all agree that education is a vehicle of knowledge that leads to the land of self discovery.</p>

        <div class="para_sec">
          <p>Emerson believed that the best form of education was that of nature and that the students seek what they desire to learn. As Emerson says in the text a student must learn something he wishes himself and by doing so they will learn about themselves. Therefore, a good example of this in the text is that of story Emerson tells about his friend Sir Charles Fellowes. Fellowes as he was in the Aegean Sea he discovered sculptured ornaments in the water and he began to show interest in them and so he went and learned the greek language and taught himself. This shows that Fellowes learned something about himself while learning about the sculptures that he finds them interesting. He may have never known that if he hadn't studied the sculptures. Furthermore, through education young minds will be able to see the world around them through their own eyes and not someone else's. Emerson says in the text to respect the pupil so he can find his own meaning. “It is not for you to choose what he shall know, what he shall do. It is chosen and foreordained, and he only holds the key to his own secret”(1). Through the use of parallelism Emerson says the students should have the power to decide what they want to know rather than being told what they can know. Furthermore, Emerson says educate young minds so they are free from lies and closer to truth. “Happy this child with a bias, with a thought which entrances him, leads him, now into deserts now into cities, the fool of an idea. Let him follow it in good and in evil report, in good or bad company; it will justify itself; it will lead him at last into the illustrious society of the lovers of truth”(1). Through the use of parallelism Emerson says let the students discover themselves what's good and bad rather than telling them.</p>

        <div class="para_sec">
          <p>James Baldwin believed that the best form of education was of students asking questions for themselves rather than being told the answers. Therefore, Baldwin says to young African Americans to seek the truth for themselves relating to the actual history of African Americans in America as they haven’t been told the truth but lies made up by the white republic. Baldwin says, “In order to justify the fact that men were treated as though they were animals, the white republic had to brainwash itself into believing that they were, indeed, animals and deserved to be treated like animals”(2). Baldwin uses pathos here to connect to the emotions of the African Americans so that he can put his point across that history has been manipulated. Furthermore, Baldwin says to seek education that lets one see the world for themselves, and so they won’t be just another person, but someone who questions things as they have seen how flawed society is. As African Americans are unable to discover the truth, they are mistreated. Badwin says the country’s government works only for the benefit of certain people. “... I know — looking at the society which has produced him, looking at the standards of that society which are not honored by anybody, looking at your churches and the government and the politicians, understand that this structure is operated for someone else’s benefit — not for his”(2). Baldwin uses parallelism here to show the things around him is not created to benefit him. Additionally, American Africans are being manipulated so they don’t discover their actual self but if they were to see their actual self, they would be able to discover themselves. Baldwin also says African Americans are set up from a young age to fail, and so they will need to be educated on that they are set up to fail but they must overcome it to be able to see the truth behind why it is like that and not fall for the trap. “If he lives in one of those housing projects of which everyone in New York is so proud, he has at the front door, if not closer, the pimps, the whores, the junkies —  in a word, the danger of life in the ghetto”(2). Baldwin uses the repetition of the word “the” to show all the things affecting young African Americans growing up. </p>

        <div class="para_sec">
          <p>Prose argues that the books being taught in high schools are not good pieces of literature. She says that the books being taught are merely talking about moral values rather than the actual writing language itself. Additionally, Prose says that the literature being taught is not challenging students to think in a new and different way. The literature being taught has one dimensional characters either good or bad but in the real world things are not always that clear so reading literature about characters who are complex gives the students new perspectives. Therefore, Prose says teaching students to love literature promotes new ideas, perspectives, and the discovery of the student themselves, but unfortunately “only rarely do teachers propose the writing might be worth reading closely, instead, students are informed that literature is principally a vehicle for the soporific moral blather they suffer daily from their parents”(180). Therefore, Prose says teaching valuable literature to students enables them to think critically and understand themselves better by experiences many things. “Teaching students to value literary masterpieces is our best hope of awakening them to the infinite capacities and complexities of human experience, of helping them acknowledge and accept complexity and ambiguity, and of making them love and respect the language that allows us to smuggle out, and send one another, our urgent, eloquent dispatches from the prison of the self”(185).</p>

          <p>All three of the writers Prose, Baldwin, and Emerson’s arguments could have been better. Prose in her argument could have included high school students and teachers opinions on the literature they are reading but Prose doesn’t do that. Prose’s argument is one sided and she doesn’t address the other side of the argument. Prose talks too much about her personal experiences rather than asking the people she’s actually basing the argument on the students. If Prose would have tried to acknowledge the argument on the side of the teachers, then her argument would have had a bigger impact. Additionally, Prose doesn’t provide enough evidence to support her claims that the literature being taught is not good. Furthermore, Baldwin could have strengthened his argument if he had provided more logical evidence to support his claims like facts and statistics. For example, he could have compared the number of successful white students to black students. Additionally, Emerson could have better strengthen his argument if he gave the solution to better educate a large group of people who are not born a genius. My ideal educational system is similar in ways to the three of theirs. I believe education should be about the student and he or she's learning, they should have the power to decide what to learn based on their interests. </p>
